                <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Philipp Klinger, a dedicated full-stack developer and digital nomad from
                    Germany.<br>
                    Since 2022 I’ve specialized in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS with Angular on the frontend —
                    and in recent years I’ve expanded my skills to the backend with Python, Django, REST APIs and
                    Docker.
                </p>
                <p>As a freelancer, I enjoy the challenge of bringing clients visions to life by combining
                    proven full-stack practices with AI-assisted workflows that speed up development and
                    providing tailor-made solutions for various applications.
                    <br>
                    My diverse portfolio demonstrates my adaptability and commitment to technical and creative
                    excellence.
                </p>
                <p>I see myself not as a designer but as a problem solver — whether it’s refactoring, system
                    architecture or implementing complex requirements.<br>
                    <br>
                    Let’s work together to achieve exceptional results.</p>
