                <p>I'm Philipp Klinger, a dedicated software developer and digital nomad from
                    Germany. <br>
                    Since 2022, I've specialized in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks like Angular.

                    My primary goal is to turn designers' visions into reality and offering solutions
                    for diverse applications. <br>
